[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com) is a website that discusses statistics for nearly every topic, especially politics, economics, and sports. Their unique style for creating plots can be used in python by calling `plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')`. \n",

    "[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is another Python package that is capable of creating advanced data plots. The kind of plots you can create with the Seaborn library are pretty neat, though pretty tricky if you're just starting out. Luckily, we can use their unique and appealing style without having to use the package itself by calling `plt.style.use('seaborn')`.\n",
